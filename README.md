Selenium 6 â€“ Homework

Navigate to Cargodom and log in with your existing user.

Go to my account and change the password. Password strength should be such that 4 of the dashes turn green.

Confirm that the 4 dashes in password strength field indeed turned green. Confirm that the password has been changed. 

Log out and sign in with the new password. Confirm that you've signed in.


Added teardown to reset the changed password in order to run the same test multiple times.
